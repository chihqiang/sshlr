# ‚úÖ SSH client connection configuration: supports multiple remote servers
ssh:
  - name: serverA                # Unique identifier, referenced in tunnels and reverse_tunnels
    user: root                   # SSH login username
    host: 127.0.0.1              # SSH host address (can be IP or domain)
    port: 8022                   # SSH port (default 22, customizable)
    password: "123456"           # Password authentication (alternative to private key)

    # üîê Private key authentication (optional, omit password if using key)
    # private_key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa           # Path to private key file (supports ~)
    # private_key: |                       # Or paste PEM formatted private key directly (supports multiple types)
    #   <your-private-key-content>
    # passphrase: "your_key_passphrase"   # Passphrase for encrypted private key (if any)

# ‚úÖ Forward tunnel configuration: local port forwarding ‚ûú remote server (equivalent to ssh -L)
local:
  - ssh: serverA                 # Which SSH client to use (matches name above)
    local: 127.0.0.1:8888        # Local listen address (access this port to forward)
    remote: 127.0.0.1:80         # Forward target address (remote service port, e.g., nginx)

# ‚úÖ Reverse tunnel configuration: remote port forwarding ‚ûú local service (equivalent to ssh -R)
remote:
  - ssh: serverA
    local: 127.0.0.1:8080        # Local service address (service running on your machine)
    remote: 127.0.0.1:8088       # Remote server listen port (accessible externally)
